# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors – Python Mini Project

A simple command-line game built as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge!

## 🔍 Project Overview

This is a beginner-friendly Python project where you play the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game against the computer.

✅ First to 3 wins  
🎨 Colored terminal output using `colorama`  
📘 Covers concepts like:
- User input
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Random choice generation

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed and install `colorama` if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install colorama

Then run:
python rock_paper_scissors.py

🎨 Features
Interactive command-line interface

Score tracking for both user and computer

Colorful feedback:

🟩 Green for wins

🟥 Red for losses or invalid input

🟨 Yellow for ties and prompts

📷 Demo

Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
First to 3 wins! Let's go!

Choose rock, paper, or scissors:
> rock
Computer chose: scissors
✅ You win this round!

Score - You: 1 | Computer: 0

**So the logic is:**
Rock crushes Scissors

Scissors cuts Paper

Paper covers Rock

If both players choose the same thing, it’s a tie 🤝

🧪** How it works in code:**
Each time:

You (the player) enter a choice (rock, paper, or scissors)

The computer randomly picks one of the three

The game compares both choices to decide who won the round

The first to win 3 rounds is the overall winner

🧠 What I Learned
Control flow (if/elif/else)
Looping with while
Using external libraries like colorama
Handling user input and edge cases



✅ Day 9: Added a winner screen 🎉 and replay option 🔁
